1) What is Linux and cmd for user management?
	Linux is an open-source operating system, and cmd is a command-line interface for user management.
	Linux is an open-source operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility.
	Cmd (Command Prompt) is a command-line interface in Windows for executing commands.
	In Linux, user management involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts.
	Commands like 'useradd', 'usermod', and 'userdel' are used for user management in Linux.
	Cmd commands like 'net user', 'net localgroup', and 'net accounts' are used for user management in Windows

2) How does a Linux boot?
	Stages: 
The machine’s BIOS or boot microcode hundreds and runs a boot loader.
Boot loader finds the kernel image on the disk and loads it into memory, to start the system.
The kernel initializes the devices and their drivers.
The kernel mounts the basis filesystem.
The kernel starts a program referred to as init with a method ID zero
init sets the remainder of the system processes in motion.
For some purpose, init starts a method permitting you to log in, typically at the top or close to the top of the boot sequence.

                                              (OR)
3) Explain how Linux mechanisms work, especially when the system starts?
  1. BIOS/UEFI: Initial hardware checks, hand over control to the bootloader.
  2. Bootloader (GRUB): Loads the Linux kernel and initramfs/initrd.
  3. Linux Kernel: Initializes hardware, loads drivers, mounts root filesystem.
  4. init/systemd: Manages services, starts critical processes, reaches target 
    runlevel.    
  5. User Login: Starts user session, graphical or command-line interface.
                                        (OR)
4)Boot process of Linux, crontab shell script?
      The boot process of Linux involves several stages, including BIOS, bootloader,    kernel initialization, and system initialization.
	The boot process starts with the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) initializing hardware and performing a Power-On Self-Test (POST).
	The bootloader, such as GRUB or LILO, is then loaded to locate and load the Linux kernel.
	The kernel initializes essential components, sets up memory, and mounts the root file system.
	The init process is started, which executes startup scripts and launches system services
