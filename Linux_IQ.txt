1) What is Linux and cmd for user management?
	Linux is an open-source operating system, and cmd is a command-line interface for user management.
	Linux is an open-source operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility.
	Cmd (Command Prompt) is a command-line interface in Windows for executing commands.
	In Linux, user management involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts.
	Commands like 'useradd', 'usermod', and 'userdel' are used for user management in Linux.
	Cmd commands like 'net user', 'net localgroup', and 'net accounts' are used for user management in Windows

2) How does a Linux boot?
	Stages: 
The machine’s BIOS or boot microcode hundreds and runs a boot loader.
Boot loader finds the kernel image on the disk and loads it into memory, to start the system.
The kernel initializes the devices and their drivers.
The kernel mounts the basis filesystem.
The kernel starts a program referred to as init with a method ID zero
init sets the remainder of the system processes in motion.
For some purpose, init starts a method permitting you to log in, typically at the top or close to the top of the boot sequence.
