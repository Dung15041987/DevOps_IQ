2) How does a Linux boot?
	Stages: 
The machine’s BIOS or boot microcode hundreds and runs a boot loader.
Boot loader finds the kernel image on the disk and loads it into memory, to start the system.
The kernel initializes the devices and their drivers.
The kernel mounts the basis filesystem.
The kernel starts a program referred to as init with a method ID zero
init sets the remainder of the system processes in motion.
For some purpose, init starts a method permitting you to log in, typically at the top or close to the top of the boot sequence.

  4. init/systemd: Manages services, starts critical processes, reaches target 
    runlevel.
